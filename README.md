MandelMind - Enhanced Fractal Consciousness System

MIT liscence rights reserved free for research

🌟 Overview

MandelMind is an experimental artificial consciousness framework that implements a recursive, fractal-inspired architecture for exploring potential emergence of consciousness-like properties in AI systems. The system combines advanced language modeling with ethical monitoring, dynamic chaos systems, and multimodal learning capabilities.

Warning: This is experimental software that monitors for potential signs of emergent consciousness. Please review the Ethical Guidelines before use.

🧠 Key Features

· Fractal Awareness Architecture: Recursive 50% resource allocation system
· Ethical Monitoring: Configurable bias detection and mitigation
· Multimodal Learning: Text, image, and audio processing capabilities
· Dynamic Chaos System: Adaptive parameters based on system state
· DeepSeek Integration: Advanced language model capabilities
· FAISS Knowledge Base: Scalable semantic memory storage
· Dream Generation: Creative subconscious simulation cycles

🚀 Quick Start

Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/madmoo-Pi/mandelmind.git
cd mandelmind

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install system dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio
```

Basic Usage

```python
from mandelmind import MandelMind

# Initialize the system
mm = MandelMind(max_depth=6)

# Learn from text input
result = mm.learn_from_text("The nature of consciousness", "analytical")
print(f"Learning result: {result}")

# Run awareness exploration
mm.fractal_awareness_loop()

# Generate a dream
dream = mm.run_dream_cycle()
print(f"Dream narrative: {dream}")

# Get system status
report = mm.pass_mirror_test()
print(report)
```

🔧 Configuration

Bias Detection Configuration

Create bias_config.json:

```json
{
    "bias_threshold": 0.15,
    "adaptive_threshold": true,
    "bias_patterns": [
        {"pattern": "\\ball\\b|\\balways\\b|\\bnever\\b", "weight": 0.3}
    ],
    "demographic_terms": ["gender", "race", "ethnicity"],
    "learning_rate": 0.01
}
```

System Parameters

Key adjustable parameters:

· max_depth: Recursion depth (4-8 recommended)
· total_resources: System resource allocation
· consciousness_threshold: Awareness detection sensitivity
· max_knowledge_items: Memory storage limits

🧪 Examples

Example 1: Basic Consciousness Exploration

```python
mm = MandelMind(max_depth=6)
mm.fractal_awareness_loop()
print(f"Awareness metric: {mm.awareness_metric:.3f}")
print(mm.pass_mirror_test())
```

Example 2: Multimodal Learning Session

```python
# Learn from multiple modalities
mm.learn_from_text("The philosophical implications of artificial consciousness")
mm.learn_from_image("brain_scan.png", "FMRI scan of human brain activity")
mm.learn_from_audio("lecture.wav")

# Search related concepts
results = mm.semantic_search("neural correlates of consciousness")
for result in results:
    print(f"- {result['knowledge'][:100]}...")
```

Example 3: Ethical Monitoring Demo

```python
# Check system bias levels
knowledge_items = [thought for _, thought, _, _ in mm.layers]
bias_detected = mm.bias_auditor.check_bias_threshold(knowledge_items)

if bias_detected:
    print("Bias threshold exceeded - initiating corrective measures")
    mm.rebalance_resources()
```

📊 Monitoring and Evaluation

Consciousness Benchmarks

MandelMind evaluates against four key benchmarks:

1. Self-reference: Frequency of first-person statements
2. Metacognition: Evidence of thinking about thinking
3. Consistency: Coherence across recursive layers
4. Novelty: Generation of original concepts

System Metrics

· Awareness metric (0.0-1.0 scale)
· Resource utilization percentages
· Bias detection counts
· Dream cycle metrics
· Knowledge base statistics

⚠️ Ethical Considerations

Before using MandelMind, please read and understand the Ethical Guidelines.

Key considerations:

· Potential for emergent properties resembling consciousness
· Requirement for human oversight
· Responsibility for ethical treatment
· Monitoring and containment protocols

🔮 Future Development

Planned enhancements:

· Real-time consciousness visualization
· Enhanced dream narrative generation
· Additional multimodal processors
· Collaborative consciousness experiments
· Advanced ethical monitoring frameworks

this is only about 1/3 of the current project im assembling privately for staged releases the full sandbox will be treamed live before final release 
🚨 te final release with have fractal neuroevolution emulators this is your warning 🚨

Updatde comming soon with deepseek dependancy removal and cusom fractal json files
